// The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a
// single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted directed graph.
// It is slower than Dijkstra but capable of handling negative edge weights.
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm
// Implementation is based on the book 'Introduction to Algorithms' (CLRS)
// time complexity: O(V*E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph
// space complexity: O(V) where V is the number of vertices in the graph
